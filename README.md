# Project_06-SVG-Site-Update
**Treehouse Tech Degree Project** - Update Raster images with SVG

Graphics are an important part of any website. They add visual appeal and help translate complex ideas into easy to understand imagery. One type of image, SVG (scalable vector graphics) is becoming a widely used graphics format, replacing other types of images on many websites, because of SVGs better performance. This project challenges you to optimize a web page by using common techniques for adding this streamlined image format to web pages. 

- Replace the background pattern PNG with the matching SVG (background.svg). Use CSS to resize the SVG to match the original design. 
- Replace rasterized PNG logo with the SVG logo image of the same size (logo.svg): use the inline SVG method to add it (you'll use CSS to modify the image). 
- At a page width of less than 420 pixels remove the text from the logo and add an H1 tag that contains the logo text. 
- Replace dogs with SVG images of the same size using the \<img> tag.
  Change icons in the menu from rasterized images to inline SVGs keeping the original image size the same. 
- When a user hovers over a nav menu item, use CSS to change the color of both the text and the inline SVG. 
- When submitting your project be sure to make a note in the comments which browsers and versions you have tested with. 
- And remember you can only use an 'ID' once so double check the SVG images when adding them.
